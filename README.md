# MOO-stuff
Various objects and verbs I've written for use with the LambdaMOO server

Here are some objects and verbs that I think could come in handy for anyone who is using the LambdaMOO server, or one of its derivatives.
Feel free to install them on your own server and make changes. If you think you can improve them, feel free to submit your changes.

Enjoy!
