This scheduler object offers the standard "timer" tasks as other scheduler objects do, but it also offers a scheduler very similar in functionality to Cron.

Installation:

Installation is mostly straightforward. Just install scheduler.moo. It will port the object and corify it.
THe only thing you may want to change is how task errors are dealt with.
Lines have been commented out in check_cron_tasks and check_timer_tasks, after the "except" line. You can uncomment them, or do something else.
